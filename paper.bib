  abstract = {In urban areas across Europe, high air temperatures and urban heat islands (UHIs) greatly affect public health, with climate change further increasing the mortality risks. This study presents a validated high resolution (100~m) hourly air temperature dataset for 100 European cities for a 10-year period (2008--2017) that is made available for urban climate research. The data is used to analyse the UHI (as defined in this study) of these 100 cities, using a dedicated indicator that is suitable for comparison across Europe. The UHI indicator is found to be correlated to both meteorological and urban characteristics. Using a statistical model, the current and potential cooling of green infrastructure and soil unsealing in the 100 cities is quantified. The Europe-wide current impact of these climate adaptation measures on the UHI indicator is found to range between 0.03 and 1.82~{$^\circ$}C (with an average value of 0.45~{$^\circ$}C), which is significant compared to the UHI indicator values ranging between 0.57 and 2.54~{$^\circ$}C (with an average value of 1.43~{$^\circ$}C). Nevertheless, a large potential for extra cooling from such measures is found to remain in many cities, ranging between 0 and 1~{$^\circ$}C, with the Europe-wide average value being 0.49~{$^\circ$}C, slightly higher than the estimated current cooling.},
